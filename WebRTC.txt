WebRTC stands for Web Real Time Communication. 
It's an API developed by Google to support real time communication among browsers(Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc.)

WebRTC encapsules complex low-level API calls and is used in javascript. 

WebRTC is for p2p communication. It supports text, video, audio, and data communication among peers.

Main components of WebRTC:
	MediaStreamAPI(getUserMedia) makes it easire for developers to acquire meida via camera or other media devices.
	RTCPeerConnection is the component that handles stable and efficient communication of streaming data between peers.
	RTCDataChannel enables p2p exchange of arbitary data with low latency and high throughput.

ICE is a framework that allows WebRTC to overcome the complexities of real-world networking. Its ICEs job to find the best path to connect peers.
A STUN server allows clients to discover their public IP address and the type of NAT they are behind. 
A TURN server remains in the media path after the connection has been established. That is why the term relay is used to define TURN. A TURN server literally relays the media between the WebRTC peers.
